# Review the Yeoman-generated app

Open up your ***mytodo*** directory to take a look at what was actually scaffolded. It'll look like this:

![](/assets/img/codelab/image_11.png)

In *mytodo*, we have:

***app***: a parent directory for our web application

  * ***index.html***: the base html file for our Angular app
  * ***404.html***, ***favicon.ico***, and ***robots.txt***: commonly used web files so you donâ€™t have to create them yourself
  * ***bower_components***: a home for our JavaScript/web dependencies, installed by Bower
  * ***scripts***: our own JS files
      * ***app.js***: our main Angular application code
      * ***controllers***: our Angular controllers
  * ***styles***: our CSS files
  * ***views***: a place for our Angular templates

***Gruntfile.js***, ***package.json,*** and ***node_modules***: configuration and dependencies required by our Grunt tasks

***test*** and ***karma.conf.js***/***karma-e2e.conf.js***: a scaffolded out test runner and the unit tests for the project, including boilerplate tests for our controllers.
