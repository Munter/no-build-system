# Set up your dev environment

Most of your interactions with Yeoman will be through the command line. Run commands in the Terminal app if you’re on Mac, your shell in Linux, or [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) if you are on Windows.

## Install prerequisites

Before installing Yeoman, you will need the following:

* NodeJS v0.10.x+
* npm (which comes bundled with Node) v1.3.7+

You can check if you have Node and npm installed by typing:

```js
$ node --version && npm --version
```

If you need to upgrade or install Node, the easiest way is to use an installer for your platform. Download the *.msi* for Windows or *.pkg* for Mac from the [NodeJS website](http://nodejs.org/download/).

## Install the Yeoman toolset

Once you’ve got Node installed, install the Yeoman toolset:

```js
$ npm install --global yo
```

  <h2>Errors?</h2>

  <p>If you see permission or access errors, you will need to prepend <code>sudo</code> to the above command, like so:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo npm install --global yo
</pre>

</div>

## Confirm installation

It is a good idea to check that everything is installed as expected by running commonly used Yeoman commands like `yo`, `bower`, and `grunt` with the `--version` flag as follows:

```js
$ yo --version && bower --version && grunt --version
```

Running the above should output four separate version numbers:

* Yeoman
* Bower
* Grunt
* Grunt CLI (the command-line interface for Grunt)
