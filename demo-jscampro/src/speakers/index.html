                                    <h4>Talk: <strong>Braitenberg and the Browser</strong></h4>
                                    <p>In the 1970s, an Italian neuroscientist published a book describing a series of imaginary mechanical vehicles with increasingly sophisticated analog sensors. Valentino Braitenberg may not have envisioned a world where we all carry sensor-rich devices in the form of mobile phones. His work however reveals the seductive power of natural simulation and offers insight into our intimate connection with devices.</p>

<p>In this talk we'll learn how to use JavaScript as creative tool to build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg Vehicles</a> and other natural simulations in a web browser. First, we'll act as influencers and learn how to connect browser-hosted simulations to the physical world and capture a range of analog input. Next, we'll act as observers and learn how to export our creations to HD video. Each step along the way we'll leverage JavaScript and highlight practical takeaways you can use in your own projects.</p>

                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>Minified JavaScript Craziness</strong></h4>
                                     <p>Imagine a single blank sheet of paper… What would you create if you could start from scratch, without dependencies and only have a super limited amount of space available? Martin will introduce you to the art of code golfing and explain how to manually shift bytes to create complex programs in less than 1k of JavaScript. Prepare for a mind bending talk where we hack tweet-sized games, bypass security with six different characters and animate self-modifying code.</p>

                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>The glitch in the game</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Testing webpages is the inglorious bastard of our time. We tamed this beast called unit testing and got out unharmed of the maze of integration tests. But are we done yet? Is this all there is? Clearly not!</p>
<p>In this talk I will demo some more tools and techniques that will help you detect glitches, failures and weird behaviour of your pages and apps. It will answer questions web developers mostly avoid to ask:
<ul>
<li>How can I automate image diffs to ensure visual consistency?</li>
<li>How can I test my CSS cross browser?</li>
<li>How can I monkey test my frontend?</li>
<li>How can I ensure that my frontend performance stays consistent over time?</li>
</ul>
</p><p>There is no such thing like a "silver bullet" that takes care of all of this, but a few tools exist, and now it is our turn to pick'em up and use them to fix the web!</p>

                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>Static Site Strategies</strong></h4>
                                     <p>Are we over-engineering? What is the real effort in developing, hosting and maintaining sites which have many moving parts?  The cost of serving static sites has never been lower. And front-end development practices have never been richer. Couldn't we harness these better and make life simpler without dumbing down?<br>

In this talk we'll explore some unexpected capabilities And characteristics of "static" sites. We'll look at ways to use emerging tools and services to create robust, high performance sites which can be more dynamic than some of their heavier and more costly brothers and sisters.You'll find that you can build faster, smarter, and more dynamic sites than you expected, without the need for complex back-ends.</p>

                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>Getting touchy - an introduction to touch and pointer events</strong></h4>
                                     <p>Beyond smartphones and tablets, touchscreens are finding their way into
                                    laptops and even desktop computers. With hardware support for touch
                                    becoming increasingly ubiquitous, it's time to explore what new
                                    possibilities are available to developers. This session will cover the
                                    basics of handling touch events - from making sure simple single-tap
                                    interactions are as responsive as possible, all the way to full
                                    multitouch, gesture-enabled, cross-browser interface components.</p>

                                    <p>Tero Parviainen is an independent software maker with 12 years of enterprise-grade yak shaving under the belt. During this time he has worn many different hats, ranging from consultant to startup CTO. His weapons of choice are JavaScript, Clojure, Ruby, and Java.<br>
Tero is the creator and organizer of the Clojure Cup programming competition and author of two books: The self-published <a href="http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular/">"Build Your Own AngularJS"</a> and "Real-time Web Application Development with Vert.x" from Packt Publishing. </p>
                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>Build Your Own AngularJS</strong></h4>
                                     <p>AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework with a steep learning curve. The inner workings of features like directives, transclusion, data binding, and dependency injection are shrouded in mystery. When you’re trying to get things done, mystery is not helpful.<br>
This talk is all about demystifying the internals of Angular. We’ll take some of the tricky aspects of Angular and build them from the ground up, live on the spot. In the process we’ll gain a deep understanding of what makes this framework tick.</p>

                                     <h4>Talk: <strong>The no build system build system</strong></h4>
                                     <p>In the good old days you could learn frontend development viewing source and learning from others. Since then we have learned a lot about frontend and web optimization. Performance is the foundation on which user experience is built, but it turns out what we are doing to our code in the name of web performance is not developer friendly. <br>This talk will focus on how you can use tools to make your code and workflow more human again and move the optimization concerns away from your daily development flow. </p>
